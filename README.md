# medical_cost_prediction
This project predicts medical costs using machine learning based on patient demographics and health factors. Built with Python, it leverages Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib for data processing and visualization. Using regression algorithms, the model achieves over 80% accuracy in cost estimation.
